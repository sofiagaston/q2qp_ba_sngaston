                <h1>OUR BACKGROUND</h1>
                    <p>
                        The Philippine Animal Welfare Society (PAWS), founded in 1954 by Muriel Jay, originally focused on fundraising through handmade items. After a period of dormancy, Nita Hontiveros-Lichauco reorganized PAWS in 1986. New members joined in 1996, establishing a cattery and sending rescued dogs to a farm in Pangasinan. The Paws Animal Rehabilitation Center (PARC), initiated in 2000, provides refuge for animals rescued from cruelty. Currently led by directors Anna Cabrera, Cristina Martinez, Rich Illustre, and Doris Cruz, PAWS continues its commitment to animal welfare.

                    <p>
                        PAWS is a registered non-profit organization which is dedicated to the protection and the promotion of humane treatment of all animals. Ending Pet Homelessness PAWS is committed to eliminating the problem at the root. Neutering (‘kapon’) is the most effective solution.
